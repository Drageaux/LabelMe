# LabelMe #
### Labeling daily life objects with their definitions in a certain language ###

- Purpose: to bring **passive learning** of a language into your daily life
- How-To: categorize objects into their respective environments (office, school, dining room, etc.) and stick small labels on them
- Current Goal: help students learn American Sign Language (ASL) across campus; in this case, we put pictures of hand signs on objects

- Challenge: getting everyone to agree with this idea is hard, so ***we need a lot of supporters***!
